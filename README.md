# Datadog Test Site

Site deployed at [AWS](http://datadog-test-site.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/) and [Amplify](https://main.dsil1b5ijwqvu.amplifyapp.com/)

This site uses Hugo, Bootstrap 4, and Sass. This is my first attempt using Hugo (a static site generator), which was difficult, but interesting. More work on templating needed - I used a custom template. This is a 1 page site (index landing page) with all links set up, but currently resolving to home.

To deploy and develop on a host machine, install hugo. Clone repo down. Use `$ hugo server -D`.
